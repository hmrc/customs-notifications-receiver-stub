# Session Timeout
# ~~~~
# The default session timeout for the app is 15 minutes (900seconds).

# timeout 15 minutes after login (regardless of user activity).

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# !!!WARNING!!! DO NOT CHANGE THIS ROUTER
